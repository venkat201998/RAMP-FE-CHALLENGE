Chnages made:

1. The fixed position property has been removed for the dropdown container.
2. Checkbox for each transaction was initially hidden because the display property was set to "none". Instead of just making it visible, I moved the "onchange" function to label itself using the "onclick" function.
3. Replaced "fetchWithoutCache" with "fetchWithCache" to fetch the latest mock data from json after checking or unchecking the transaction approval.
4. The "View More" botton has been hidden for each employee selection page by adding a state "Employee" as a condition. As it was loading all the transactions irrespective of the selection of a specific employee.
5. The absence of ID for the "All Employee" option in the dropdown dialog led to runtime error. this was taken care by adding an extra check.
6. For the "View More" button, there was a runtime error when the botton was interacted on the last page of transaction list. This was fixed by adding an extra check.
